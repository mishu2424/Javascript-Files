// year: "numeric": This means you want to display the full year (like "2024"). If you used "2-digit",

// month: "long": This specifies that you want the full name of the month (like "December").
//  If you used "short", it would show the abbreviated name (like "Dec").
// day: "numeric": This means you want to display the day of the month as a number (like "28" for the 28th).
//  If you used "2-digit", it would show the day with two digits (like "08" for the 8th).
